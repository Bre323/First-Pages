          <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>

          <p>There are no such prerequisites to learn Python but having a basic knowledge of any programming language concepts like what is a loop, what if and else does, how operators are used, etc. will be helpful. If you have strong command over the basics of any programming language, you can learn Python quickly.</p>

          <p>Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).</p>
          <p>
            To print a string, just write the following code:
          </p>
          <div id="hworld">
          <code>
            print("Hello World")
          </code>
          </div>
            </article>

          <p>Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object. In this documentation you will see two types of variables.</p>
          <p>The first type is the number variable. Python supports two types of numbers - integers(whole numbers) and floating point numbers(decimals). (It also supports complex numbers, which will not be explained in this tutorial).</p>
          <p>To define an integer or a floating number, use the following syntax:</p>
          
          <div id="var">
          <code>x = 1</code><br>
          <code>y = 7.5</code>
          </div>
            
         <p>
           You can define a string with single or double quotes:
         </p>
          
          <div id="mystr">
          <code>mystr = 'String with single quotes'</code><br>
          <code>print(mystr)</code><br>
          <code>mystr2 = "String with double quotes"</code><br>
          <code>print(mystr2)</code>
            </article>
        </section>

            Python uses boolean logic to evaluate conditions. True or False are the values that can be returned when a expression is compared or evaluated. If the value returned is True, the block of commands inside the 'if' statement will be executed, and if its false you can execute another block with the 'else' statement.

          <p>
            For loops can iterate over a sequence of numbers using the "range" and "xrange" functions. The difference between range and xrange is that the range function returns a new list with numbers of that specified range, whereas xrange returns an iterator, which is more efficient. (Python 3 uses the range function, which acts like xrange). Note that the range function is zero based. The while statement is a loop that can execute as long as the expression returns a 'False' value.
